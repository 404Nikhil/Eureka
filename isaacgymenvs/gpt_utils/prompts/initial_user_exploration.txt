The Python environment is {task_obs_code_string}. The task: {task_description}. This task is very challenging to learn from scratch,
so we must construct an explicit curriculum of tasks and learn the tasks in sequence. Please propose a task curriculum and write a reward function for each task in the curriculum.

For each subtask in the curriculum, please format your code as follow:
Task:
Reward Function Code: 
```
```

For this step, just output the code for the first subtask.
