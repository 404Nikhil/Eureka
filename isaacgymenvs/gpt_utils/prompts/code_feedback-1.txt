Please thoroughly analyze the feedback on the policy and create an improved reward function that can more effectively solve the task. Consider the following tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates consistently approach zero, you will need to completely rewrite the reward function.
    (2) If the values for a particular reward component are consistently similar, this indicates that RL is unable to optimize that component in its current form. You may want to consider:
        (a) Adjusting the scale or temperature parameter of the component.
        (b) Rewriting the reward component.
        (c) Removing the reward component altogether.
    (3) If the magnitude of certain reward components is significantly larger than others, you will need to rescale their values to an appropriate range.
Please perform the above analysis on each existing reward component before writing the code for the reward function.
