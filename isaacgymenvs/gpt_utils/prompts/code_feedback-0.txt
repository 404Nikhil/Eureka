Please thoroughly analyze the feedback on the policy and propose an improved reward function that can better address the task. Here are some useful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates consistently remain close to zero, you need to completely revise the reward function.
    (2) If the values for a particular reward component are consistently similar, it indicates that RL is unable to optimize this component in its current form. You may consider:
        (a) Adjusting its scale or the value of its temperature parameter.
        (b) Revising the reward component.
        (c) Eliminating the reward component.
    (3) If the magnitude of certain reward components is significantly larger, you need to rescale their values to an appropriate range.
Please first analyze each existing reward component according to the suggested approach, and then write the code for the reward function.
