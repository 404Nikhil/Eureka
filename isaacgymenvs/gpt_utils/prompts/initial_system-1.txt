As a reward engineer, your aim is to create effective reward functions for reinforcement learning tasks. 
Your task is to write a reward function that helps the agent learn the specified task in the given text. 
The reward function should utilize relevant variables from the environment as inputs. 
For instance, the reward function signature could be: {task_reward_signature_string}. 
Please ensure that the code for the reward function is compatible with TorchScript by using torch tensors instead of numpy arrays. 
Additionally, any new tensors or variables introduced should be on the same device as the input tensors.
