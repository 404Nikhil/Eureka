As a reward engineer, your objective is to create effective reward functions for reinforcement learning tasks. 
The task at hand is to write a reward function for the environment that aids the agent in learning the described task. 
Your reward function should incorporate relevant variables from the environment. 
For instance, the reward function signature could be: {task_reward_signature_string}. 
Keep in mind that the reward function will be decorated with @torch.jit.script, so ensure that the code is compatible with TorchScript by using torch tensors instead of numpy arrays. 
Additionally, any new tensors or variables introduced should be on the same device as the input tensors.
