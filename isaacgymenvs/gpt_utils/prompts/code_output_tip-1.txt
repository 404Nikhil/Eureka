The reward function should produce two items as output:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary containing each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a string of Python code: "```python ... ```".

Here are some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it useful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components.
    (2) If you decide to transform a reward component, you must also include a temperature parameter inside the transformation function. This parameter should be a named variable within the reward function and should not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable.
    (3) Ensure that the type of each input variable is correctly specified. A float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor.
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must only contain attributes of the provided environment class definition. These attributes are variables that have the prefix self.. It is not allowed to introduce new input variables under any circumstances.
