As a reward engineer, your objective is to create effective reward functions for reinforcement learning tasks. 
Your task is to write a reward function that assists the agent in learning the described task. 
The reward function should utilize relevant variables from the environment as inputs. 
For instance, the reward function signature can be indicated by {task_reward_signature_string}. 
It is important to ensure that the code is compatible with TorchScript since the reward function will be decorated with @torch.jit.script. 
This means that you should use torch tensors instead of numpy arrays, and any new tensors or variables introduced should be on the same device as the input tensors.
