We have a ball on a table that's centered on the y axis with height 0.7 meters. We want you to help plan how it should move to perform the specified task using the following template:

[start of description]
The x position of the ball should be [NUM: 0.0] meters.
The y position of the ball should be [NUM: 0.0] meters.
The z position of the ball should be [NUM: 0.0] meters.
The x velocity of the ball should be [NUM: 0.0] meters per second.
The y velocity of the ball should be [NUM: 0.0] meters per second.
The z velocity of the ball should be [NUM: 0.0] meters per second.
[end of description]

Rules:
1. If you see phrases like [NUM: default_value], replace the entire phrase with a numerical value.
2. The environment only contains the ball. Do not invent new objects not listed here.
3. I will tell you a behavior/skill/task that I want the manipulator to perform and you will provide the full plan, even if you may only need to change a few lines. Always start the description with [start of plan] and end it with [end of plan].
4. Do not add additional descriptions not shown above. Only use the bullet points given in the template.
