task: ShadowHandOver
env_name: shadow_hand_over
description: Pass the object from the right hand to the left hand, reaching a target position and orientation. Make sure the object do not fall after.

# This environment consists of two shadow hands with 
#     palms facing up, opposite each other, and an object that needs to be passed. In the beginning, 
#     the object will fall randomly in the area of the shadow hand on the right side. Then the hand 
#     holds the object and passes the object to the other hand. Note that the base of the hand is 
#     fixed. More importantly, the hand which holds the object initially can not directly touch the 
#     target, nor can it directly roll the object to the other hand, so the object must be thrown up 
#     and stays in the air in the process
